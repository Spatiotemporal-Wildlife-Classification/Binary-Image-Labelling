"""This file performs the binary image labelling.

    The file allows you to tailor the binary image labelling to suite the use case by adapting specific variables.
    Please consult the README or Documentation for further information.


    Attributes:
        root_path (str): The absolute path of the project root.
        data_path (str): The complete path (absolute + relative) to the project `data` directory
        observation_path (str): The complete path to the `data/observations/` directory. This directory contains the iNaturalist observations.
        labelled_path (str): The complete path to the `data/labelled/` directory. This directory contains a record of the labelled observations.
        labelled_file (str): The filename of where the labelling history is going to be collected.
        image_path (str): The complete path to where the images to be labelled are found.
        labelled_image_path (str): The complete path to the directory where the labelled images are saved in binary directories to seperate the classes after being labelled.
        binary_labels (dict): Linking of the numerical key values to the expected labels. An `ignore` label is also provided.
        positive_count (int): The count of the number of positive labels recorded
        negative_count (int): The count of the number of negative labels recorded
        ignore_class (str): The variable enables specification of a class to ignore recording labels for. Review the README or documentation for more information.
